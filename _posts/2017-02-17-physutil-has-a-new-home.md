We've migrated PhysUtil to the [PERL at MSU github organization][PERLgithub]. The reason for this move is to consolidate much of the research and development work that is being done by the [PERL group][PERLMSU] to a single github orngaization rather than having such work scattered across various personal sites.

Here, you'll find everything that the old PhysUtil site had including PhysUtil itself, but you will soon find a website with better documentation and quicker news updates.

Feel free to poke around.
