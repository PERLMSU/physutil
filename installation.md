PhysUtil is a Python module that helps students generate highly-visual VPython programs. Installation is very simple.

1. Download the physutil.py script
2. Place the physutil.py script in the same folder as the VPython script you are writing.
3. Call physutil in your script using `import physutil`

It's that simple.
