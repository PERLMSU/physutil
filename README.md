## PhysUtil
PhysUtil is an open-source module that can be used generate motion diagrams 
(stroboscopic images), graphs and timers from within a VPython or Glowscript program. 
PhysUtil was constructed to help students with little or no programming experience to 
create highly visual simulations using [VPython](http://www.vpython.org) or [Glowscript](http://www.glowscript.org).

### Documentation

Extensive documentation on the use of different classes developed for PhysUtil is [located on the wiki](https://github.com/perlatmsu/physutil/wiki).
